# Whole Slide Image Tiling Pipeline

This repository contains the code used to convert CZI format slide images into a tiled JPEG format. This converts images into a format suitable for use with other image analysis pipelines, such as a Cell Classification pipeline.

Included are scripts for tiling CZI format Whole Slide Images, producing tiled Tissue Segmentation masks, and Stain Normalised tiles.
